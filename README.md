## Overview
Our project has three main features that an autonomous batmobile should at least have. A [stop sign detector](#stop-sign-detector) that stops the car for 3 seconds then continues to move again. A [color detector](#color-detector), that speeds up when it detects green (the Joker), slows down when it detects blue (civilians), and stops on red. (We needed a way to stop the car) The last feature is an [obstacle avoider](#obstacle-avoider). The batmobile detects an obstacle and avoids it.

## ROS2 Layout
There were three main components per feature:
* **CONSTANT_SPEED.py**

* ***FEATURE*.py**

* **CMD_ARBITER_*FEATURE*.py**
