## Overview
Our project has three main features. A stop sign detector that stops the car for 3 seconds then continues to move again until the camera detects the stop sign again.We run a model directly on the OAK-D-lite camera that detects the stop sign. The next feature we implemented is a speed/slow boost. If the camera detects green, it has a speed boost for X seconds. If the camera detects blue, it slows down for X seconds. The last feature we implemented is an obstacle avoider. Using the lidar, we detect an object and the car will avoid it and continue moving.
